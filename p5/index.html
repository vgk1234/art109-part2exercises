    <p>Based off this -> <a href="https://p5js.org/examples/motion-bouncy-bubbles.html"><b>p5 sketch</b></a></p>
    <p>I have always thought about using a bubble sketch or some other dynamic sketch in the background of 
    my project. This is something I think would be great to describe emotions and internal feelings. This 
    particular example below is something I could see decribing feelings of stress or anxiousness.
